The following files contains the vhdl code for the implementation of various hardwares.
Each file contains a set of Hardware description code, Test code, Makefile and Readme.
Hardware description code describes the architecture of the hardware.
Test codes provides the test values for testing.
Makefile contains instructions for the compilation and stimulation of code.
Readme describes the working of the code.
Compilation of the code was done by GHDL.
GTKWAVE is used for the stimulation of the output.
